Elisa music player

## Introduction

Elisa is a simple music player designed to provide users with a nice experience.
Elisa supports browsing music by album, artist or all tracks. The music is
indexed using either a private or Baloo-based indexer. The private indexer can be
configured to scan music in chosen paths. The Balloo indexer is faster since
Baloo provides all necessary data from its own database. Users can build and play
their own playlist.

## Contributions

Contributions are very much welcome. Elisa follows a design by the [KDE VDG team](https://community.kde.org/KDE_Visual_Design_Group/Music_Player).
Please use KDE's Phabricator instance to contribute.
